Simple and stupid program for locally serving a static web page that has URL rewrite rules.

Why? Because I want to locally preview my web page before I publish it, but I can't be arsed to
start up Apache or another fully-featured web server just so that URLs work correctly for otherwise
static pages.

Currently only designed for one specific website, might make it more generic if the need arises.
